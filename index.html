                    </figure>
                    <p>Toucans range in size from the lettered aracari (Pteroglossus inscriptus), at 130 g (4.6 oz) and
                        29 cm (11 in), to the toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), at 680 g (1.50 lb) and 63 cm (25 in). Their
                        bodies are short (of comparable size to a crow's) and compact. The tail is rounded and varies in
                        length, from half the length to the whole length of the body. The neck is short and thick. The
                        wings are small, as they are forest-dwelling birds who only need to travel short distances, and
                        are often of about the same span as the bill-tip-to-tail-tip measurements of the bird.</p>

                            the smallest species of toucan.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p class="clear-right">The legs of the toucan are strong and rather short. Their toes are arranged
                        in pairs with the
                        first and fourth toes turned backward. The majority of toucans do not show any sexual dimorphism
                        in their coloration, the genus Selenidera being the most notable exception to this rule (hence
                        their common name, "dichromatic toucanets"). However, the bills of female toucans are usually
                        shorter, deeper and sometimes straighter, giving more of a "blocky" impression compared to male
                        bills. The feathers in the genus containing the largest toucans are generally purple, with
                        touches of white, yellow, and scarlet, and black. The underparts of the ara√ßaris (smaller
                        toucans) are yellow, crossed by one or more black or red bands. The toucanets have mostly green
                        plumage with blue markings.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>The colorful and large bill, which in some large species measures more than half the length of
                        the body, is the hallmark of toucans. Despite its size, the toucan's bill is very light, being
                        composed of bone struts filled with spongy tissue of keratin[4] between them. The bill has
                        forward-facing serrations resembling teeth, which historically led naturalists to believe that
                        toucans captured fish and were primarily carnivorous; today it is known that they eat mostly
                        fruit. Researchers have discovered that the large bill of the toucan is a highly efficient
                        thermoregulation system, though its size may still be advantageous in other ways.[5][6] It does
                        aid in their feeding behavior (as they sit in one spot and reach for all fruit in range, thereby
                        reducing energy expenditure), and it has also been theorized that the bill may intimidate
                        smaller birds, so that the toucan may plunder nests undisturbed (see Diet below). The beak
                        allows the bird to reach deep into tree-holes to access food unavailable to other birds, and
                        also to ransack suspended nests built by smaller birds.</p>
                    <p>A toucan's tongue is long (up to 15 cm (5.9 in)), narrow, grey, and singularly frayed on each
                        side, adding to its sensitivity as a tasting organ.</p>
                    <p>A structural complex probably unique to toucans involves the modification of several tail
                        vertebrae. The rear three vertebrae are fused and attached to the spine by a ball and socket
                        joint. Because of this, toucans may snap their tail forward until it touches the head.[7] This
                        is the posture in which they sleep, often appearing simply as a ball of feathers, with the tip
                        of the tail sticking out over the head.</p>

                        <p>Toucans are native to the Neotropics, from Southern Mexico, through Central America, into
                            South America south to northern Argentina. They mostly live in the lowland tropics, but the
                            mountain species from the genus Andigena reach temperate climates at high altitudes in the
                            Andes and can be found up to the tree line.[8]</p>
                        <p>For the most part the toucans are forest species, and restricted to primary forests. They
                            will enter secondary forests to forage, but are limited to forests with large old trees that
                            have holes large enough to breed in. Toucans are poor dispersers, particularly across water,
                            and have not reached the West Indies. The only non-forest living toucan is the toco toucan,
                            which is found in savannah with forest patches and open woodlands.[8]</p>

                        <p>oucans are highly social and most species occur in groups of up to 20 or more birds for most
                            of the time. Pairs may retire from the groups during the breeding season, then return with
                            their offspring after the breeding season. Larger groups may form during irruptions,
                            migration or around a particularly large fruiting tree.[8]</p>
                        <p>Toucans often spend time sparring with their bills, tag-chasing and calling, during the long
                            time it takes for fruit to digest. These behaviours may be related to maintenance of the
                            pair bond or establishing dominance hierarchies, but the digestion time of fruit, which can
                            take up to 75 minutes during which the toucan can't feed,[9] provide this social time.[8]

                        <h3 id="diet">Diet</h3>
                        <p>Toucans are primarily frugivorous (fruit eating), but are opportunistically omnivorous and
                            will take prey such as insects, smaller birds, and small lizards.[10] Captive toucans have
                            been reported to hunt insects actively in their cages, and it is possible to keep toucans on
                            an insect-only diet. They also plunder nests of smaller birds, taking eggs and
                            nestlings.[11][12] This probably provides a crucial addition of protein to their diet.
                            Certainly, apart from being systematically predatory as well as frugivorous, like many
                            omnivorous birds, they particularly prefer animal food for feeding their chicks.[13]
                            However, in their range, toucans are the dominant frugivores, and as such, play an extremely
                            important ecological role as vectors for seed dispersal of fruiting trees.</p>
                        <h3 id="breading">Breeding behaviour</h3>
                        <p>Toucans nest in cavities in trees, and the presence of suitable trees is a habitat
                            prerequisite for toucans. For the most part toucans don't excavate nesting cavities,
                            although some green toucanets do.</p>

                        <p>Toucans make a variety of sounds. The very name of the bird (from Tupi) refers to its
                            predominant frog-like croaking call, but toucans also make barking and growling sounds. They
                            also use their bills to make tapping and clattering sounds. Mountain toucans are known for
                            donkey-like braying.</p>

                        <p>The toucans are, due to their unique appearance, among the most popular and well known birds
                            in the world.[8] Across their native range they were hunted for food and also kept as pets,
                            and their plumage and bills were used for decorations. In some places anyone that discovers
                            a nest is deemed its owner and is entitled to sell the birds within.[citation needed] In the
                            western world they were first popularised by John Gould who devoted two editions to a
                            detailed monograph of the family.[8] The constellation Tucana, containing most of the Small
                            Magellanic Cloud, is named after the toucan.</p>
                        <p>The family has been used prominently in advertising. During the 1930s and 1940s Guinness
                            (beer) advertising featured a toucan, as the black and white appearance of the bird mirrored
                            the stout.[8] A cartoon toucan, Toucan Sam, has long been used as the mascot of Froot Loops
                            breakfast cereal, and a toucan is the mascot of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party; its
                            party members are called tucanos for this reason.</p>
                        <p>Toucans have also been used in popular media. They have been used as the principal characters
                            in Toucan Tecs, a 1992 UK television cartoon about two detectives named Zippi and Zac. In
                            Dora the Explorer, the character Se√±or T√∫can is a Spanish-speaking toucan who occasionally
                            gives Dora and her friends advice. Tuca, the anthropomorphic title character of the 2019
                            show Tuca & Bertie is a Toucan, and the companion of the song thrush Bertie. In the 2016
                            Nintendo 3DS game Pok√©mon Sun and Moon, the Pok√©mon Toucannon and its previous evolutions
                            were modeled after a Toco Toucan.</p>
